● Create a TCP client that connects to the server.
● Send a random number of commands (0...10) to the server with randomly generated operands (not larger than 1000) and immediately disconnect from the server.
● Implement a C++ console application that starts/runs multiple instances of the client simultaneously, sending messages to the server as specified.
● Optionally, wait synchronously for server response after sending a command and write the response to standard output.
● Test scenarios with different numbers of clients, both less and more than N*10 (where N is the number of cores on the machine).
